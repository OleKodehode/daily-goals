In this project I've only used ChatGPT to create a DailyTodoGoals website

I wanted to see how much one could do with ChatGPT without interfering with the AI's code but only tell it what to do diffrently.

This has been a fun experiment, and I have learned even more about coding and how to describe what functionalities should do in order to make the AI do what I wanted it to do. I think AI's is a solid resource for debugging and small problemsolving, but I currently dont think AI's can make great websites without alot of knowledge from the person guiding the AI.
